## HTML Forms features

- Full control over the HTML for the form fields. If you want, we'll help you in generating the field HTML though.
- Each form submission is automatically saved in your database and can be viewed in a simple table format.
- Configure an unlimited amount of actions to run when a form is successfully submitted. For example, sending out email notifications.
- Access form field values by referencing the field name, eg `[NAME]` or `[EMAIL]`.
- Hide form or redirect to URL after a successful submission.
- Configurable & translatable form messages.
- Field validation.
- Developer friendly. HTML Forms comes with a myriad of [JavaScript events](https://www.htmlformsplugin.com/kb/javascript-events/) and WordPress hooks that allow you to modify or extend the plugin's default behavior.

## Who is this for?

HTML Forms is for everyone that wants a flexible & high performing form solution.

- Users. Managing your own site? With HTML Forms, you don't need any technical knowledge to setup a contact form.
- Developers. Building a site for your client? You supply the form HTML, HTML Forms takes care of validating and processing the form.
- Theme developers. Shipping a theme? HTML Forms allows for complete blend-in with your theme, and you don't have to write yet another contact form plugin.

With HTML Forms you can create any type of form. Contact forms, registration forms, price quote forms, you name it. It's somewhat similar to Contact Form 7, but without yet another template language for you to learn.
